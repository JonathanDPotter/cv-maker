# CV-Maker

This is my version of the Odin Project cv-maker project. It is intended to be an introduction to building and deploying a react app.

---

## Technologies Used

This app is written in typescript using React. Tailwindcss is used for styling, and react-pdf is used to display the CV and make it downloadable as a PDF.

---

## Functionality

The user can enter their information in the provided forms and the app fills in a PDF that can be downloaded onto their device. The PDF functionality doesn't work on mobile, so in that case the app simply displays the CV as it would look as a PDF.
